#Slides

##A PHP &amp; HTML5 &amp; CSS3 &amp; jQuery Framework for creating a simple slide deck

So far... the process is:

1. Put this somewhere PHP can run
1. Create slides in the slides folder using the template
1. Alter setup.php file to name stuff
1. Enjoy

##Bugs (please help =)

- Next and Previous don't work right (PHP array issue)

##To Do

- Browser testing (only modern, it's a slide deck, not a public website...)
- Get slide in / slide out to move different directions based on Next/Previous
- Make better and more practical slide examples
- Possibly other options for slide transitions (fade, nothing, etc)
